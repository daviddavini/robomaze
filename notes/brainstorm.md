# Game Idea

- Rougue-like game

- Controls: WASD (no diag.), mouse to shoot (crosshair for mouse)

- Bouncing bullets
- Upgrade system (more bounces, faster tank, homing, shoot through walls, teleport)

- Control scrambling "gates" (group theory logic)
- LR, UD, Rotate Clockwise, Rotate Counter
- Downgrade system

- Mix-and-match robot enemies (randomly generated, strength scales)
- Robot factory

- Boss battles (every 5 levels, linked to upgrades)

- Floor coloring system (path to exit, path to upgrades)

- Each level is floor of infinitely-tall tower (difficulty increases)
